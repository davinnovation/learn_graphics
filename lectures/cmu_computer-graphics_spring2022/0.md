Overview Computer Graphics

- understand broadly computer graphics
- algorithm ofr making images of 3d shapes

Computer Graphics

- Sketchpad (1963) is the start
- Computer Graphics : The use of computers to synthesize visual information (digital to visual) + manipulate sensory information
- SIGGRAPH 2021 trailer : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ros7ZXqLbFg
- Comptuer Graphics in Movies, Games, Entertainment, Art&Design, Industrial Design, Computer aided engineering, Architecture, Scientific/mathematical visualization, medical/anatomical visualization, Navigation, Communication

Foundation of Computer Graphics

- Basic Representations (digitally encode shape, motion)
- Sampling & Aliasing (acquire & reproduce a signal)
- Numerical Methods (manipulate signals numerically)
- radiometry & light transport (light behavior)
- perception (human inspect relation)
  ...

Drawing the Cube

- Modeling : Describe the Cube
- Rendering : Visualize the Model
- Cube
  - Centered in (0,0,0)
  - Dimension 2x2x2
  - edges are aligned with x/y/z axes
- Question
  - What are the coordinates of the cube vertices?
    - (+-1, +-1, +-1) # 8 vertices
  - What is the edges?
    - AB, AC, AE, BD, BF, CD, CG, DH, EF, EG, GH, FH
- How can we map 3D to 2D
  - Perspective Projection (Pinhole model of a camera)

Draw lines in computer

- it is pixels! : Raster Display => Rasterization
